# linfa-linalg

Provides pure-Rust implementations of linear algebra routines for `ndarray` without depending on external LAPACK/BLAS libraries.

## Eliminating BLAS dependencies

If this crate is being used as a BLAS-less replacement for `ndarray-linalg`, make sure to remove `ndarray-linalg` from the entire dependency tree of your crate. This is because `ndarray-linalg`, even as a transitive dependency, forces `ndarray` to be built with the `blas` feature, which forces all matrix multiplications to rely on a BLAS backend. This leads to linker errors if no BLAS backend is specified.
