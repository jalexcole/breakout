//! Calculate order statistics.
//!
//! This crates allows one to compute the `k`th smallest element in
//! (expected) linear time, and estimate a median element via the
//! median-of-medians algorithm.
//!
//! [Source](https://github.com/huonw/order-stat)
//!
//! # Installation
//!
//! Ensure your `Cargo.toml` contains:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! order-stat = "0.1"
//! ```
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The `kth` function allows computing order statistics of slices of
//! `Ord` types.
//!
//! ```rust
//! let mut v = [4, 1, 3, 2, 0];
//!
//! println!("the 2nd smallest element is {}", // 1
//!          order_stat::kth(&mut v, 1));
//! ```
//!
//! The `kth_by` function takes an arbitrary closure, designed for
//! order statistics of slices of floating point and more general
//! comparisons.
//!
//! ```rust
//! let mut v = [4.0, 1.0, 3.0, 2.0, 0.0];
//!
//! println!("the 3rd smallest element is {}", // 2
//!          order_stat::kth_by(&mut v, 2, |x, y| x.partial_cmp(y).unwrap()));
//! ```
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[derive(Debug)]
//! struct Foo(i32);
//!
//! let mut v = [Foo(4), Foo(1), Foo(3), Foo(2), Foo(0)];
//!
//! println!("the element with the 4th smallest field is {:?}", // Foo(3)
//!          order_stat::kth_by(&mut v, 3, |x, y| x.0.cmp(&y.0)));
//! ```
//!
//! The `median_of_medians` function gives an approximation to the
//! median of a slice of an `Ord` type.
//!
//! ```rust
//! let mut v = [4, 1, 3, 2, 0];
//!
//! println!("{} is close to the median",
//!          order_stat::median_of_medians(&mut v).1);
//! ```
//!
//! It also has a `median_of_medians_by` variant to work with
//! non-`Ord` types and more general comparisons.
//!
//! ```rust
//! let mut v = [4.0, 1.0, 3.0, 2.0, 0.0];
//!
//! println!("{} is close to the median",
//!         order_stat::median_of_medians_by(&mut v, |x, y| x.partial_cmp(y).unwrap()).1);
//! ```
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[derive(Debug)]
//! struct Foo(i32);
//!
//! let mut v = [Foo(4), Foo(1), Foo(3), Foo(2), Foo(0)];
//!
//! println!("{:?}'s field is close to the median of the fields",
//!         order_stat::median_of_medians_by(&mut v, |x, y| x.0.cmp(&y.0)).1);
//! ```

/// Compute the `k`th order statistic (`k`th smallest element) of
/// `array` via the Floyd-Rivest Algorithm[1].
///
/// The return value is the same as that returned by the following
/// function (although the final order of `array` may differ):
///
/// ```rust
/// fn kth_sort<T: Ord>(array: &mut [T], k: usize) -> &mut T {
///     array.sort();
///     &mut array[k]
/// }
/// ```
///
/// That is, `k` is zero-indexed, so the minimum corresponds to `k =
/// 0` and the maximum `k = array.len() - 1`. Furthermore, `array` is
/// mutated, placing the `k`th order statistic into `array[k]` and
/// partitioning the remaining values so that smaller elements lie
/// before and larger after.
///
/// If *n* is the length of `array`, `kth` operates with (expected)
/// running time of *O(n)*, and a single query is usually much faster
/// than sorting `array` (per `kth_sort`). However, if many order
/// statistic queries need to be performed, it may be more efficient
/// to sort and index directly.
///
/// For convenience, a reference to the requested order statistic,
/// `array[k]`, is returned directly. It is also accessibly via
/// `array` itself.

/// If the order of the original array, or position of the element is

/// let kth = *order_stat::kth(&mut v.iter().collect::<Vec<&i32>>(), 2);
///
/// // the position is the difference between the start of the array
/// // and the order statistic's location.

///
/// assert_eq!(*kth, 10);
