//! **Recent Updates:**
//!
//! Version 0.5.0 reset the default availability of optional features,
//! at a cost of incompatibility with some previous build configurations.
//!
//! Versions 0.4.5 and 0.4.6 provided bug fixes, especially concerning the
//! Hash trait for cstr, expanded abilities to concatenate strings. All
//! string types except for `fstr` now support no_std.
//!
//! Version 0.4.4 added the optional `cstr` type.
//!
//! Version 0.4.3 added the optional `Sharestr` type along with other, minor
//! enhancements.
//!
//! Version 0.4.2 improved the implementation of zstr to require all bytes
//! following the first zero byte to also be zeros, which allows the length
//! of the string to be found by binary search.  
//!
//! Version 0.4.0 introduced no_std support
//!
//! Version 0.3.2 introduced the [Flexstr] type.
//!
//! Version 0.3.1 implements `Deref<Target=str>` and removed
//! some redundant procedures.  The functions `to_ascii_lowercase`
//! and `to_ascii_uppercase` **has been renamed to `to_ascii_lower` and
//! `to_ascii_upper`**, to avoid clash with those from the Deref trait.
//!
//! Version 0.2.12 includes contribution from
//! [wallefan](https://github.com/wallefan),
//! and added optional serde support for serialization.
//! This feature can be enabled by giving cargo the
//! **`--features serde`** option.
//!
//! Version 0.2.11 impls [core::fmt::Write], thereby enabling the [write!]
//! macro. Also adds new macros [str_format!] and [try_format!].
//!
//! Version 0.2.10 allows str4-str128 strings to be concatenated with
//! the `+` operator, resulting in strings with twice the capacity,
//! str8-str256.  This feature is only implemented for the strN types.
//!
